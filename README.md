# website
Here is where my site's files are going to be saved for all eternity

## why no js?

Javascript makes things slower and I don't need it.
Not using it, is a sort of technical challenge, to keep the project interesting.

Also, I know people that don't allow js to be executed in their browsers, and I want them to see my website the way it was intended to be seen.
