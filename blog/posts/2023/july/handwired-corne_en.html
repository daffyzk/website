                has been a disaster for my free time...

            <h4>My first DIY Keyboard, the Corne</h4>
            <p>
                About 2 years ago, I decided that, after finishing my custom-wireless-superlight-fully_3d_printable-g303 mouse, I wanted to go back on my dream to build my own keyboard. <br />
                Back in those times I was still using my good old Corsair Strafe RGB full-size keyboard, with the Windows key desoldered (for a better gaming experience). <br />
                That keyboard was with me for almost 5 years, it had many beverages spilt upon it (and other liquids), and underwent many unorthodox procedures, like the time I decided that my monthly cleaning was NOT enough. <br />
                and opted for a more in-depth cleaning method: Desoldering all the keys, cleaning it and putting it back together. (lmao) <br />
                Let's go back in time a bit. <br />
            </p>
            <h3>3 years ago</h3>
            <p>
                I didn't know much about keyboards, all I knew is that I wanted something different... <br />
                That's how this journey started, looking around, trying to find how all the 'Standard' keyboard layouts were called, finally arriving to the conclusion that I wanted to build a 75% keyboard. <br />
                It was a no brainer, it had all the keys I needed for my gaming needs, and in my mind, everything was perfect. <br />
            </p>
            <img src="../../../assets/kbs/keychron75.jpg" alt="Image of a 75% keyboard | Model = Keychron K3">
            <p>
                Precisely after an hour I arrived at my brilliant conclusion, that's when I realized something really important: 
                <ul>
                    <li>I was unemployed</li>
                    <li>Had no money</li>
                    <li>Did't have any tools</li>
                </ul>
                So... the project got put on hold...  
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily for me, a year after that... (I know. It's a long story, but I'm getting there) <br />
                I managed to secure my first job as a Manual QA engineer, but that's a tale for another blog-post. <br />
                And that is how, after getting my first paycheck, I went to my mom, stole her credit card, and financed a 3d printer in 6 interest-free payments. <br />
                I wasn't making a lot of money, but at least I could buy my little machine that I wanted to have since I was 16, to build that aforementioned custom-wireless-superlight-fully_3d_printable-g303 mouse. <br />
                Build I did, took me a good 200 hours of blender time, but I managed to create the epitome of gaming mice, <b>the w303</b>. <br />
                <br />
                <i>"A logitech g303 shaped mouse that's fully wireless, solid as a rock, weighs only 50 grams and is 100% 3D printable with no required extra parts"</i>  <br />
                 (Quoting myself here) <br />
            </p>
            <img src="../../../assets/w303/w303v1.jpg" alt="Image of the w303 | Wireless g303 project">
            <h3>This was not the end...</h3>
            <p>
                I needed to build more... MORE... <br />
                I was at a point in my professional career where doing Manual QA (Testing) was not as cool as it used to be, I wanted to code. <br />
                Whilst using my corsair keyboard, and attempting to get faster at touch typing, I became familiar with other <i>types</i> of keyboards. <br />
                Those Microsoft ergo keyoboards, The Moonlander, The Kinesis Advantage, and many others. <br />
                But one video that called my attention: <br />
                <br />
                [Thought I was going to find it but couldn't, this video is long lost to the ethers of the internet] <br />
                [Just imagine a video of a guy putting this small little keyboard inside is backpack - cut - then he is pulling it out for a college class or something] <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../assets/kbs/crkbd.jpg" alt="Image of a cool Corne Keyboard build I found">
                This keyboard looked INCREDIBLE, so portable, so neat. <br />
                An ergonomics-first-machine of pure performance and portability. <br />
                <br />
                Bu-but... what about... how do you press the numbers, and the specials keys? <br />
                How could you do anything with this number of keys? <br />
                FUCK THE NUMBER OF KEYS. <br />
                <br />
                If you are typing, you don't need to have that many keys available all at once. <br />
                There is no possible way, that for any regular usecase, you have click every single key on a keyboard at the same time. <br />
                (Unless you're using intelliJ, lol) <br />
                
                I fell in love with the philosophy of the Corne Keyboard. <br />
                I fell in love with the community it had, all this people creating their own keyboards, their own layouts. <br />
                Making their own tool to connect their brain as efficiently as possible to their computer. <br />
            </p>
            <h3>The choice was made...</h3>
            <p>
                Yet again, problems arose. <br />
                Tough I did have more disposable income than before, I wasn't sleeping on money. <br />
                I mean just a couple paragraphs before I said that I had to finance a 300 dollar printer, because my salary wasn't high enough to pay for it all at once. <br />
                Buying a pcb and having it internationally shipped was out of the question. With shipping to argentina included, the end price came to almost 100 dollars. <br />
            </p>
            <h3>ONE HUNDRED BUX!</h3>
            <p>
                No way that was gonna happen, specially since at the time, that was like 1/3 of my paycheck. <br />
                It had to be handwired. <br />
                Back in those days, there were barely any guides on the internet for making handwired keyboards, and I wasn't familiar enough with how it worked to make my own design. <br />
                I was lost. <br />
                Right then and there, I had an epiphany, a deity of some sort, blessed me with a good idea for once in my life. <br />
                The Corne keyboard is an opensource project, and there was a way to get the wiring diagram I needed... <br />
            </p>
            <h3>What is a PCB? A miserable bundle of wires!</h3>
            <p>
                Let's cut to the chase, if you download the project file of a PCB, you can look at how the whole thing is wired, and copy what you need. <br />
                In my case, I didn't need any downward facing LEDs, no addressable RGB backlight for the keys or any other bells and whistles. <br />
                By just removing everything else besides the switch wires from the PCB project in KiCad, I got myself the wiring diagram that I yearned for. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I had a wiring diagram, but no keyboard case... And I wasn't going to have that shipped to the end of the world either. <br />
                Though there were some STLs available on the internet for free, there is no way in hell I will make ANY project easier for me. <br />
                'I'll just make my own!' I naively thought. <br />
                So I did, I made my own design, made it more angular, more aggressive and less round and fluffy. <br />
                Let's not talk about the specifics of why that design wasn't perfect, I've been using the keyboard for over a year and many problems came up, but the first one was:
            </p>
            <h3>Not being patient enough</h3>
            <p>
                I was so excited to build the keyboard after 'finishing' the 3d model that I got everything ready. <br />
                My 42 switches (Kaihl Box Red), plenty of 1N4148 diodes, two pro-micros, trrs jacks and sockets, two 64x128 Oled screens, and some small generic pcb's with plated through-holes. <br />
                I was so exited, that I decided that waiting for the print-bed to cool before ripping my print for it was going to take too long. <br />
                So I just took my plate off the print-bed as soon as the printer stopped, causing it to warp a fair bit. :S
            </p>
            <h3>The build process</h3>
            <p>
                Building the keyboard was fairly simple, just a matter of wiring everything the correct way, and I was done in a couple of hours. <br />
                One of the disadvantages of using wires instead of a PCB is that it does take longer to build, but it's not that bad. <br />
                What was pretty bad, was my wiring into the micro-controller. <br />
                To those familiar with spaghetti code, there is an equivalent to that in electronics, and it was pretty much what I ended up doing. <br />
                No regrets though, the keyboard pretty much worked perfectly. <br />
                After testing all I had to do was screw the backplate in and... <br />
                Wait, what was that noise? A crack, a pop of sorts, the sound of plastic breaking. <br />
                Turns out the screw wholes I designed were not as robust as they needed to be... <br />
                No problem really, the keyboard worked with a couple screws missing, and I was happy. <br />
            </p>
            <h3>Back to reality</h3>
            <p>
                Some things were updated from what they used to be. <br />
                Specifically the screws...  <br />
                They all fell off sooner or later, so I had to improvise something to prevent my keyboard from falling apart everytime I used it. <br />
                Solution? Look no further than the Edo period in Japan, about 423 years ago, when Shibari (the ancient Japanese artform) started out. <br />
                What? BDSM? What is that? Some sort of UNIX alternative? <br />
                Not sure what you're talking about buddy, we're just tying up loose ends here. <br />
            </p>
            <h3>The end of an era</h3>
            <p>
                Much like the Edo period of japan, good things always come to an end. <br />
                This keyboard, as unfinished and imperfect as it is, can be considered a completed project. <br />
                It's current state is good enough to use at home, and take to a cafe when I'm out and about doing my computer stuff. <br />
            </p>
            <h3>From the ashes, another era... ehhh, emerges...</h3>
            <p>
                There is always another project, another keyboard to be built. <br />
                One of the things I noticed after giving my wife the last standard mechanical keyboard I had (The one on my gaming puter), is that a Corne, is not very good for gaming. <br />
                The row stagger makes it really hard to use wasd, ctrl is on a wierd spot, and the most important part, there are NO NUMBERS. <br />
                How the heck... am I supposed to switch from my picaxe to my sword while running from an archer in minecraft?? <br />
                Ain't no way! You have to do a layer shift, and since I have mouse-keys configured on mi Lower layer, I can't access asd when using the numbers. <br />
                No, no, no! This is unacceptable! I MUST build another keyboard... It's the only solution. <br />
            </p>
            <h4>The italic woteec keyboard, coming soon to a thingiverse near you.</h4>
            <p>
                The 'worst-typing-experience-ever-created' or wootec, is a 75% orthotropic split keyboard <br />
                with a gaming-first russian-language compatible design <br />
                You will see what I mean... <br />
