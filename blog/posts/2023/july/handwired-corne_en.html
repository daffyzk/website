                has been a disaster for the human race...
                
                About 2 years ago, I decided that, after finishing my custom-wireless-superlight-fully_3d_printable-g303 mouse, I wanted to go back on my dream to build my own keyboard.
                Back in those times I was still using my good old Corsair Strafe RGB full-size keyboard, with the Windows key desoldered (for a better gaming experience).
                That keyboard was with me for almost 5 years, it had many beverages spilt upon it (and other liquids), and underwent many unorthodox procedures, like the time I decided that my monthly cleaning was NOT enough
                and opted for a more in-depth cleaning method: Desoldering all the keys, cleaning it and putting it back together. (lmao)
                Let's go back in time a bit.
            </p>
            <h3>3 years ago</h3>
            <p>
                I didn't know much about keyboards, all I knew is that I wanted something different...
                That's how this journey started, looking around, trying to find how all the 'Standard' keyboard layouts were called, finally arriving to the conclusion that I wanted to build a 75% keyboard.
                It was a no brainer, it had all the keys I needed for my gaming needs, and in my mind, everything was perfect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Precisely after an hour I arrived at my brilliant conclusion, that's when I realized something really important:
                <ul>
                    <li>I was unemployed</li>
                    <li>Had no money</li>
                    <li>Did't have any tools</li>
                    <li>And I was on my own</li>
                </ul>
                That's how the project got put on hold...
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily for me, a year after that... (I know. It's a long story, but I'm getting there)
                I managed to secure my first job as a Manual QA engineer, but that's a story for another day.
                And that is how, after getting my first paycheck, I went to my mom, stole her credit card, and financed a 3d printer in 6 interest-free payments.
                I wasn't making a lot of money, but at least I could buy my little machine that I wanted to have since I was 16, to build that aforementioned custom-wireless-superlight-fully_3d_printable-g303 mouse.
                Build I did, took me a good 200 hours of blender time, but I managed to create the epitome of gaming mice, a g303 shaped mouse that was fully wireless, solid as a rock, and weighed 50grams.
            </p>
            <h3>This was not the end...</h3>
            <p>
                I needed to build more... MORE...
                I was at a point in my professional career where doing Manual QA (Testing) was not as cool as it used to be, I wanted to code.
                Through using my corsair keyboard, and trying to get faster at touch typing, that's when I became familiar with other types of keyboards.
                Those Microsoft ergo keyoboards, The Moonlander, The Kinesis Advantage, and many others. 
                But one video that called my attention:
                [Thought I was going to find it but no shot bucko, this video is long lost to the ethers of the internet]
                [Just imagine a video of a guy putting this small little keyboard inside is backpack and pulling it out in a college class or something like that]
            </p>
            <p>
                This keyboard LOOKED incredible, so portable, so neat looking.
                An ergonomics-first-machine of pure performance and portability.

                Bu-but... what about... how do you press the numbers, and the specials keys?
                How could you do anything with this number of keys?
                FUCK THE NUMBER OF KEYS.
                If you are typing, you don't need to have that many keys available all at once.
                There is no possible way, that for any regular usecase, you have click every single key on a keyboard at the same time.
                (Unless you're using intelliJ, lol)
                
                I fell in love with the philosophy of the Corne Keyboard. 
                I fell in love with the community it had, all this people creating their own keyboards, their own layouts.
                Making their own tool to connect their brain as efficiently as possible to their computer.
            </p>
            <h3>The choice was made...</h3>
            <p>
                Yet again, problems arose.
                Tough I did have more money than before, I wasn't sleeping on a bed of cash. 
                I mean just a couple paragraphs before I said that I had to finance a 300 dollar printer, because I didn't make enough to pay for it all at once.
                Buying a pcb and having it internationally shipped was out of the question. With shipping to argentina included, the end price came to almost 100 dollars.
            </p>
            <h3>ONE HUNDRED BUX!</h3>
            <p>
                No way that was gonna happen, specially since at the time, that was like 1/3 of my paycheck.
                It had to be handwired.
                Back in those days, there were barely any guides on the internet for making handwired keyboards, and I wasn't familiar enough with how it worked to make my own design. 
                I was lost.
                Right then and there, I had an epiphany, a deity of some sort, blessed me with a good idea for once in my life.
                The Corne keyboard is an opensource project, and there was a way to get the wiring diagram I needed...               
            </p>
            <h3>What is a PCB? A miserable bundle of wires!</h3>
            <p>
                Let's cut to the chase, if you download the project file of a PCB, you can look at how the whole thing is wired, and copy what you need.
                In my case, I didn't need any downward facing LEDs, no addressable RGB backlight for the keys or any other bells and whistles.
                By just removing everything else besides the switch wires from the PCB project in KiCad, I got myself the wiring diagram that I yearned for.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I had a wiring diagram, but no keyboard case... And I wasn't going to have that shipped to the end of the world either.
                Though there were some STLs available on the internet for free, there is no way in hell I will make ANY project easier for me.
                'I'll just make my own!' I naively thought.
                So I did, I made my own design, made it more angular, more aggressive and less round and fluffy.
                Let's not talk about the specifics of why that design wasn't perfect, I've been using the keyboard for over a year and many problems came up, but the first one was:
            </p>
            <h3>Not being patient enough</h3>
            <p>
                I was so excited to build the keyboard after 'finishing' the 3d model that I got everything ready.
                My 42 switches (Kaihl Box Red), plenty of 1N4148 diodes, two pro-micros, trrs jacks and sockets, two 64x128 Oled screens, and some small generic pcb's with plated through-holes.
                I was so exited, that I decided that waiting for the print-bed to cool before ripping my print for it was going to take too long.
                So I just took my plate off the print-bed as soon as the printer stopped, causing it to warp a fair bit. :S
            </p>
            <h3>The build process</h3>
            <p>
                Building the keyboard was fairly simple, just a matter of wiring everything the correct way, and I was done in a couple of hours.
                One of the disadvantages of using wires instead of a PCB is that it does take longer to build, but it's not that bad.
                What was pretty bad, was my wiring into the micro-controller. 
                To those familiar with spaghetti code, there is an equivalent to that in electronics, and it was pretty much what I ended up doing.
                No regrets though, the keyboard pretty much worked perfectly. 
                After testing all I had to do was screw the backplate in and...
                Wait, what was that noise? A crack, a pop of sorts, the sound of plastic breaking.
                Turns out the screw wholes I designed were not as robust as they needed to be...
                No problem really, the keyboard worked with a couple screws missing, and I was happy.
            </p>
            <h3>Back to reality</h3>
            <p>
                Some things were updated from what they used to be.
                Specifically the screws... 
                They all fell off sooner or later, so I had to improvise something to prevent my keyboard from falling apart everytime I used it.
                Solution? Look no further than the Edo period in Japan, about 423 years ago, when Shibari (the ancient Japanese artform) started out.
                What? BDSM? What is that? Some sort of UNIX alternative?
                Not sure what you're talking about buddy, we're just tying up loose ends here.
            </p>
            <h3>The end of an era</h3>
            <p>
                Much like the Edo period of japan, good things always come to an end.
                This keyboard, as unfinished and imperfect as it is, can be considered a completed project. 
                It's current state is good enough to use at home, and take to a cafe when I'm out and about doing my computer stuff.
            </p>
            <h3>From the ashes, another era... ehhh, emerges...</h3>
            <p>
                There is always another project, another keyboard to be built.
                One of the things I noticed after giving my wife the last standard mechanical keyboard I had (The one on my gaming puter), is that a Corne, is not very good for gaming.
                The row stagger makes it really hard to use wasd, ctrl is on a wierd spot, and the most important part, there are NO NUMBERS.
                How the heck... am I supposed to switch from my picaxe to my sword while running from an archer in minecraft??
                Ain't no way! You have to do a layer shift, and since I have mouse-keys configured on mi Lower layer, I can't access asd when using the numbers.
                No, no, no! This is unacceptable! I MUST build another keyboard... It's the only solution.
            </p>
